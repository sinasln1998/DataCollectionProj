### Overview
This Python-based data collection tool is designed to gather external data relevant to fertilizer inventory and demand planning in the agricultural sector. It automates the retrieval of data from multiple sources, facilitating informed decision-making for agricultural businesses.
### Features
- Modular Data Collection: Easily integrates multiple data sources such as industry sales trends, economic indicators, social media trends, government websites, competitor data, crop data, transport data, and crop yield data.
- Flexible Configuration: Uses config.yaml for specifying API endpoints, parameters, and data fetch functions, allowing easy addition of new data sources without altering core code.
- Data Processing: Utilizes pandas for data manipulation and analysis, ensuring data is structured and ready for further processing.
- Error Handling and Logging: Implements error handling and logging (logging module) to maintain robustness and traceability during data fetching and processing.
### Project Structure
The project includes the following components:

- data_collection.py: Main Python script responsible for fetching data from configured sources based on parameters specified in config.yaml.
- config.yaml: Configuration file specifying data sources, API endpoints, parameters, and fetch functions. 
- requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies required to run the project. Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
